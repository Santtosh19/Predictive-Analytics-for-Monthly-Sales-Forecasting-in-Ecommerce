# Predictive-Analytics-for-Monthly-Sales-Forecasting-in-Ecommerce
This project aims to develop a predictive model for forecasting monthly sales in an ecommerce setting at the SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) level. Leveraging historical sales data, the project focuses on predicting future revenues for individual products, taking into account various factors such as unit prices, product colors, sizes, and seasonal trends.

## Dataset

 The dataset includes the following key columns:

- order_id: Unique identifier for each order.
- order_date: Date of the order.
- sku: Product identifier.
- color: Color of the product.
- size: Size of the product.
- unit_price: Price per unit.
- quantity: Quantity sold.
- revenue: Calculated as unit_price * quantity.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the data for modeling.
- Revenue Prediction: Forecasts revenue for the next few months.
- Visualization: Plots the predicted revenue for each SKU.
- Power BI Dashboard: A Power BI file is included for advanced data visualization and interactive analysis.

## Customization
### This project is designed to be flexible and customizable:

- Feature Engineering: Adjust the features used for prediction based on your dataset.
- Model Tuning: Experiment with different models and hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
- Visualization: Modify the plots or create new ones to better represent your data.
